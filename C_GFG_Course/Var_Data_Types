a variable is a name assigned to a memory block in the main memory.

For constants variable, the name should be in all upper-case alphabets and multiple word are separated by underscores (_).

They are basically a label to memory location.
Variables naming rules .
SEE PROMOTION rules in C.
By default floating constant is of double data type.by suffixing it with f or F, we can convert it to float data type.

sizeof operator size --  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sizeof-operator-c/

when we create curly braces it creates a scope. CURLY BRACKETS DEFINE A BLOCK OF SCOPE , ANYTHING DECLARED BETWEEN CURLY BRACKS
GOES OUT OF SCOPE AFTER THE CLOSING BRACKET.
