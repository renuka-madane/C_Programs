What is the meaning of using extern before function declaration? For example following function sum is made 
extern extern int sum(int x, int y, int z) {     return (x + y + z); }
a)Function is made globally available b)extern means nothing,
sum() is same without extern keyword. c)Function need not to be declared before its use d)Function is made local to the file Correct
answer is option 'B'. Can you explain this answer?

What is the meaning of using static before function declaration? 
For example following function sum is made static static int sum(int x, int y, int z) 
{     return (x + y + z); } a)Static means nothing, sum() is same without static keyword.
b)Function need not to be declared before its use c)Access to static functions is restricted to the file where 
they are declared d)Static functions are made inline Correct answer is option 'C'. Can you explain this answer?

#include "stdio.h"
int main()
{
 int a = 10;
 int b = 15;

 printf("=%d",(a+1),(b=a+2));
 printf(" %d=",b);

 return 0;
} ans -- =11 12== as per C std. a;; arg of printf are evaluated,even if they get printed or not, hence b=a+2 will be evaluated 
and b will be 12 after 1st printf.
