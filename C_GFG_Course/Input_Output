Even if we write floating point no., its converted to double b4 we print it. FLOAT data type is automatically upgraded b4 printing.
Strings are stored as character arrays in C, so when reading strings, the variable name itself acts as the address (since strings are character arrays), 
so the & operator is not required.
fgets(name, len, stream);
In C, strings are null terminated, meaning an additional character (\0) is added to the end of the string. So, len parameter should always be 1 + the desired 
size and it includes the space for the null terminator (\0).
Originally, fgets() was designed to read input from files. However, by providing stdin as the input stream, it can read from standard input,
like user input from the keyboard. This makes it versatile for various use cases.

 fgets(name, 100, stdin);

Why Use fgets()?
In the past, the gets() function was commonly used to read strings, but it was considered unsafe. It lacked a mechanism to limit the 
number of characters being read,which could lead to buffer overflows and make programs vulnerable to attacks. For this reason, gets() has been deprecated in modern versions of C.

The fgets() function addresses these issues by allowing programmers to specify the maximum number of characters to read, 
including the null terminator (\0). This safety feature makes it a preferred choice for reading strings.
By default, %f prints 6 digits after the decimal point.
In the case of long double values, the format specifier becomes %Lf for fixed-point representation.
