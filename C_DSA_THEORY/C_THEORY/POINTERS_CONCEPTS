The syntax of pointers depends on the type they are pointing to.  type*ptr;
To declare a pointer, we use the (*) dereference operator before its name.
We use the (&) addressof operator to get the memory address of a variable and then store it in the pointer variable.  (*) dereferencing operator
As pointers in C store the memory addresses, their size is independent of the type of data they are pointing to. This size of pointers in C only depends on the system architecture.
The reason for the same size is that the pointers store the memory addresses, no matter what type they are. As the space required to store the addresses of the 
different memory locations is the same, the memory required by one pointer type will be equal to the memory required by other pointer types.
An array name acts like a pointer constant. The value of this pointer constant is the address of the first element. For example, if we have an array named val then val and &val[0] can be used interchangeably.
